# ImageLabeling
## Easy-Peazy
--------------
- Clone this repo
- Create two folders inside of static/img/
    - one named 'target'
    - the second name 'completed'
- Place all jpg and png files you want to caption in static/img/target/
- While your pwd is in the project root directory run this:
`python3 app.py`
- Keep labeling until the monkey is reached. Once reached all renamed files should be in completed along with the metadata.csv containing all your labeling.
- Copy the completed file to where ever you might need it
- Clean out the target adn completed directories.
